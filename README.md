# Box2DLights - Pseudo 3d [development]

[![screenshot](http://img.youtube.com/vi/8Jc5Xyy4yJU/0.jpg)](http://youtu.be/8Jc5Xyy4yJU)

This is the pseudo-3d implementation based on Kalle Hameleinen's Box2DLights.

It provides simple dynamic limited length fixtures-shaped shadows for 2d games with the "from top" camera view, where you can control the third pseudo dimension - "height" for both physics fixtures and lights.

This is in a quite an early development stage, so not everything is supported, and not everything works without bugs.

## Currently supported lights and fixture shapes:
 * Point Light
 * Directional Light (in progress)

## Fixture shapes:
   * PolygonShape
   * CircleShape
   * ChainShape (in progress)
   * EndgeShape (in progress)

## Maintenance Note
Box2dlights was moved from Google Code to Github to make contributing easier. The libgdx team will happily merge pull requests but will not fix bugs or ensure compatibility with the latest libgdx version.
